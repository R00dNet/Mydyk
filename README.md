Upon launching, you'll encounter a user-friendly GUI with various input fields and options. Here's a breakdown to guide you through:

Set Profile Name: Enter a name for your recoil settings.
Horizontal Parameter: Adjust this value to control the horizontal recoil. A higher value provides more control, but might feel less natural.
Vertical Parameter: Similarly, this adjusts the vertical recoil control.
Game Process: Type in the game's executable name (like game.exe). Mydyk will specifically target this game for recoil control.


üïπÔ∏è How to Use
After setting your preferences:
Launch Your Game: Ensure the game specified in the "Game Process" field is running.
Play as Usual: Once in-game, Mydyk will automatically manage the recoil based on your specified parameters whenever you press and hold the left mouse button (LButton).
Tip: Mydyk is designed to operate only when the game (specified in "Game Process") is in focus, preventing any unintentional mouse movements outside the game.


üîÑ Switching Profiles
If you switch between games or weapons with different recoils:
Reset Parameters and update the input fields with new values.
Dive back into your game with the new settings applied.


üì¢ Note
Mydyk is primarily designed to reduce wrist strain and improve overall gaming health by managing recoil. This tool aims to provide a more comfortable gaming experience, especially for extended sessions. It's not a cheat, and its purpose isn't to provide an unfair edge in multiplayer settings. Always respect your game's terms of service and the gaming community.
